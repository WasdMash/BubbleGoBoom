- [ ] **Cutscene manager** - *would be quite helpful to research how this is implemented in other games*
	- [ ] Should store the dialogue in like a CSV file or database or something
		- [ ] For each paragraph, we should have:
			- Something to note when the dialogue is triggered
			- Which conversation it is a part of
			- The name of the character speaking
			- The sprite of the character speaking
	- [ ] I want a typing effect as the characters speak like in other sprite games
- [ ] **Active weapon slot**
	- [ ] How to actually store it and bind its actions to a button shouldn't be hard to figure out?
- [ ] Actually creating a choice of weapons and consumables
	- [ ] ![[Buffs]]
	- [ ] ![[Player]]
- [ ] **Locking the player in a room whenever a boss is active and alive**
	- [ ] Tracking the boss' health and opening the triggers to doors when their health is 0
- [ ] **Implementing save states in the game**
	- [ ] What must be known at any given time to save the game in a meaningful way?
		- [ ] Player health
		- [ ] Player's inventory of items
		- [ ] The number of waves survived
		- [ ] Items in opened chests
			- [ ] We don't care about what's in unopened chests - their contents can be generated at runtime
		- [ ] Player position in dungeon
		- [ ] Dungeon layout
- [ ] Chests
	- [ ] Storing items within them permanently may become a key mechanic of the game
	- [ ] This relies on how I can store the procedurally generated dungeon in memory without causing lag
		- [ ] Figure out how to permanently store this data of dungeon
			- [ ] Can be used to reload the game
- [ ] Implementing an input buffer - **not totally necessary but a huge ease-of-life improvement**
- [ ]
