## **3 Consumable Slots**
- Minecraft will heavily inspire this where we can store 3 different types of items in their stacks
	- Like, there would need to be a lot of backtracking if for example, we could only store 1 soap, 1 hand sanitiser and 1 Listerine.
	- **Ability Cooldowns**: Many games feature abilities with cooldowns that are "refreshed" by achieving a certain in-game task, like getting a kill or assist, or by leveling up the ability. This instantly resets the cooldown, allowing the ability to be used again immediately.
	- **Ability Duration**: Some abilities have a limited duration that can be "refreshed" or extended by using the ability again while it is still active.
	- **Restoring Status**: In games like Pokémon, some abilities are specifically designed to refresh a status ailment, such as healing paralysis, poison, or a burn
## **1 Refreshable ability slot**
- a skill or power that can be reused, restored, or extended
- This can also be our weapon slot, forcing the user to get creative with what we use to remove enemies
	- A proper chest system to save and store items will be most necessary for it
	
## **all of them are pick-uppable and swappable from the floor**
